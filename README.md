Countdown Timer Project
This Countdown Timer project is a simple web application created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to set a specific date and time in the future, and it will display a countdown that shows the time remaining until that moment. Whether you want to count down to a special event, a deadline, or just for fun, this project is a great way to visualize the time left.
